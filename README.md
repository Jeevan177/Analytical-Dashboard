# Analytical-Dashboard

To build an analytics dashboard using Python, we can use the plotly dash framework. Dash is a productive Python framework for building web analytical applications. It’s built on top of Plotly.js and React.js.

It offers a simple interface for creating interactive, web-based dashboards. It is highly customizable and can produce very sophisticated and interactive dashboards. Dash applications are web servers running Flask and communicating JSON packets over HTTP requests.

# Building an RFM Analytics Dashboard using Python

RFM Analysis is a concept used by Data Science professionals, especially in the marketing domain for understanding and segmenting customers based on their buying behaviour.
Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customers’:

1. recency (the date they made their last purchase)
2. frequency (how often they make purchases)
3. monetary value (the amount spent on purchases)
   
Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value of a customer are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.
